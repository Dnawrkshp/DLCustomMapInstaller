How to install Deadlocked HD Custom maps onto any PS3:

Step 1:
	Get a flash drive or external HD that is formatted to FAT32 that can hold your entire PS3's HDD.
	If you don't have one big enough you must delete downloaded games until you can fit it all on.
	You can re-download them all later.
	
Step 2:
	Go to Settings in the XMB, System Settings -> Backup Utility -> Backup.
	Go through that crap, select your drive, and let it backup your PS3.
	This will take awhile.
	
Step 3:
	With the backup on your drive, plug it into your Windows PC (not supported on any other OS right now).
	
Step 4:
	Open the DLCustomMapInstaller.exe that is in the same directory as this .txt file.
	
Step 5:
	Navigate to the archive.dat that is held within the backup folders on your drive and click Open.
	Should be DRIVE:/PS3/EXPORT/BACKUP/XXXXX/archive.dat
	
Step 6:
	Click on the Add Maps button and there should be a sequence of things going on.
	This will also take some time, but not nearly as long as the backup.
	
Step 7:
	To verify that it all went well, navigate to the backup directory again but in File Explorer.
	Make sure archive_00.dat is larger than the archive_00.bak (which will either be in the same directory or in the same directory as this .txt file depending on Save Original Backup checkbox).
	
Step 8:
	Remove the drive safely.
	
Step 9:
	Plug it back into the PS3 and go to Settings -> System Settings -> Backup Utility -> Restore.
	Select the drive, select the backup you made (should be some numbers that represent a date).
	This will take some time but not as long as the backing up did.
	
Step 10:
	After the restore is complete you will be at your XMB.
	Log into PSN and go into Account Management -> System Activation -> PS3 System -> Game -> Activate System.
	
Step 11:
	You can now play Deadlocked HD with the custom maps.
	Just keep in mind you can play them but since you can't run homebrew, you can't host them.
	
	
	
Updates:
	You can click the Check for Update button in the DLCustomMapInstaller.exe program to check for any new updates.
	If there are any, then go through the steps again to install them.
	It is time consuming but it's free and works for anyone.
